> **ðŸŸ© Explanation:**
>
> - This file provides the configuration details for setting up MCP servers using the filesystem method on Windows.
> - Ensure that the specified folders and files exist at the given paths (`C:\Users\tinum\Desktop` and `C:\Users\tinum\Documents`).
> - The configuration uses `npx` to run the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` package.
> - The `disabled` flag is set to `false`, meaning the filesystem MCP server is enabled.
> - The `autoApprove` array is currently empty, which can be used for automated approval settings if needed.
